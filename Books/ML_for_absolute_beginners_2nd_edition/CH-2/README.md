### What is Machine Learning?
- Talks about 1959's IBM Paper by Arthur Samuel where he coined the defined the term ML first time that's still in use today. 
- Introduced ML as subfield of Computer Science that gives computers ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
- _Self-learning_ (not in the paper): Application of statistical modeling to detect patterns and improve performance based on data and empirical information.
- Machine learning is heavily dependent on computer programming. Difference is input data vs input command
- Input(Command) => Output(Action) [ Non-ML ] | Command > Action
- Input(Data) => Learning(Model) => Output(Action) [ML] | Data > Model > Action
- High level
    1. Data is fed to the machine
    2. Algorithm is selected
    3. Settings(hyperparameters) are configured & adjusted
    4. Machine is instructed to conduct analysis
    5. Machine detects patterns in data through trial and error.
    6. Machine's data model formed from analyzing data patterns, can then be used to predict future values
- Examples
    1. Youtube viewing habits as input to make recommendations
    2. MVP award in baseball - data = previous winners attributes (age, education, games etc)
    3. Email spam detection
- Training & Test Data
    1. Training Data = used to develop model
    2. Test Data = used to test/validate the developed model
- Machine Learning - Parent, Sister fields
    1. Parent Fields: Computer Science > Data Science > AI > ML
    2. Data Science: Methods and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data through the use of computers
    3. AI: Ability of machines to perform intelligent and cognitive tasks.
        - Search and Planning
        - Reasoning and knowldege representation
        - Perception
        - NLP
        - ML
    4. Data Mining: Sister discipline to ML - very similar but deals with past more than future.
