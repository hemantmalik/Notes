### ML Categories
- Several hundred statiscal-based algorithms in ML. Constant challenge for anyone working in this field.
- 3 Overarching categories in ML " **Supervised ML** | **Unsupervised ML** | **Reinforcement Learning**
- _**Supervised Machine Learning**
    - Learning patterns through connecting the relationship between variables and known outcomes. It works with labeled datasets
    - Sample data with various features (X), and correct output value of data (Y). This is what makes the dataset labeled - known.
    - Algorithm detects patterns to establish the relationship between the two and creates a model to reproduce.
        - Example: Market value of a used car. Dataset = previous sold cars with their features/attributes/dimensions - year, make, miles etc. Used to create model.
- _**Unsupervised Machine Learning**
    - Not all variables and data patterns are classified
    - Machine must uncover hidden patterns and create labels
    - k-means clustering algorithm popular example
        - example use-case buyers patterns
    - Helps you enable discover patterns that you dint know existed in the data.
    - Fraud detection another popular application area - you don't know what next attack pattern someone is going to use so UNKNOWN

    - Other examples
        - sudden large order from an unknown user
        - sudden surge of user ratings
        - suspicious shipping address
- _**Reinforcement Machine Learning**
    - Most advanced of the three. Continuously improves its model by leveraging feedback from previous iterations.
    - Continuous learning - outputs are graded, not tagged
    - Q-Learning as an example
    - Machine must uncover hidden patterns and create labels
    - k-means clustering algorithm popular example
        - example use-case buyers patterns
    - Helps you enable discover patterns that you dint know existed in the data.
